Quarks are observed to combine in two possible ways:
	- Into Baryons (or antibaryons): three quarks (or three antiquarks respectively)
	- Into Mesons: A quark and an antiquark (antimesons are just mesons)

# Baryons

Protons and Neutrons are examples of Baryons, and hence each comprise three quarks. The proton is composed of $UUD$ while the neutron $UDD$. Adding up the charges of the up and down quarks yeilds the correct relative charges of $+1$ and $0$ respectively. Notice that the down quark is also slightly heavier than the up quarks, and hence neutrons are slightly heavier than protons.
