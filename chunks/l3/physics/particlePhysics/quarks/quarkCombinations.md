Baryons and Mesons were identified as two separate type of particle long before the discovery of quarks: Baryons were identified as fermionic hadrons, while mesons as bosonic hadrons. It was not until after quarks were discovered that the reason for the existence of two fundementally different types of hadron was found.

Baryons are comprised of three quarks (with antibaryons being comprised of three antiquarks).
