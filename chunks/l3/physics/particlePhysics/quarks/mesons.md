Mesons are quark-antiquark pairs. We can classify mesons based on their properties.

# Pions

Pions were initially classified based on their decay modes, however, we can now think of them simply as mesons made from up and down quarks (and their corresponding antiquarks).

There are three possible pions *flavours*:
	- $\pi^+$: $u\bar{d}$
	- $\pi^-$: $d\bar{u}$
	- $\pi^0$: $u\bar{u}$ or $d\bar{d}$

The three pions are labelled by the charges they have. The $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ have identical charges, while the two possible $\pi^0$ combinations have masses less than, and greater than this mass respectively.
