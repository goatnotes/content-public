In Murray Gell-Mann's initial paper, he predicted the existence of three quarks:
	- Up: $U$
	- Down: $D$
	- Strange: $S$

He predicted that the lightest of the three, the $U$ quark, had a relative charge of $+2/3$; that the $D$ quark, being slightly heavier than the $U$, had a charge of $-1/3$, and that the $S$ quark was a slightly heavier version of the $D$ quark.

Since their initial prediction, 3 more quarks have been predicted, and experimentally verified:
	- Charm: $C$.
	- Top: $T$.
	- Bottom: $B$[^1].

The $T$ and $C$ quarks have a charge of $+2/3$ (like the up quark) whilst the $B$ quark has a charge of $-1/3$.

[^1]: You will sometimes hear the top and bottom quarks referred to as **Truth** and **Beauty** (particularly in the states). These are silly names, and I am not going to entertain their discussion any more.
