I feel that quarks deserve their own section given that they showed up a little late in particle physics. For many years it was thought that baryons and mesons were fundamental particles, along with the leptons and bosons that we still have in the standard model [^1].



[^1]: I believe you can actual find a point in the 'Feynmann Lectures on Physics' where he talks about the *fundamental* baryons and mesons, and whether one day we will find a common link between the two, in a shared composition. This is interesting given that quarks were very much a theoretical prediction; it *felt like* there should be something beneath the hadrons, and it took clever symmetry arguments to predict the existene of the quark.
