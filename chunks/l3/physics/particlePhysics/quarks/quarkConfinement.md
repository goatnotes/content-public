It is an empircal observation that no quark can be observed in isolation, only as a constituent of a hadron. Interestingly, this fact has not been mathematically proven, and is simply an empirical observation.

Although a proof for quark confinement does not exist, the reason for quark confinement at low temperatures is known. Unlike the electromagnetic interaction, whose strength between two particles decreases with their separation, the strength of the strong force is constant with particle separation [^1]. Therefore, when a quark is *pulled* away from a hadron, there reaches a point where it becomes energetically favourable for a quark-antiquark pair to be formed, rather than for the quark to be pulled further away.

[DIAGRAM]

Quark confinement isn't caused so much by the fact that the attraction of quarks to each other is too great to overcome, but rather that the strong force will always 'choose' to create more quarks (hence creating more hadrons) rather than let a quark go.

[^1]: This is because, where the carrier of the electromagnetic interaction (the photon) has no electric charge (the property linked to the electromagnetic interaction), the carrier of the strong force (the gluon) does have color charge itself, and hence interacts *with* the strong force, as well as being the carrier of it. This has the effect of giving the strong nuclear force a constant strength with separation.
