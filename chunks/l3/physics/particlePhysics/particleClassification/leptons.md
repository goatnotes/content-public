Leptons are *defined* as fermions which do not engage with the strong nuclear force. Examples of leptons include the electron ($e^-$), and the electron-neutrino ($\nu_e$). There are two further **generations** of leptons: The muon ($\mu^-$) and mu-neutrino ($\nu_\mu$), and the tau $(\tau^-$) and tau-neutrino ($\nu_\tau$).

Each generation of lepton is heavier than the last, however, there is no simple relationship between the masses of each generation. Their masses are only known empirically, and cannot be predicted by current particle physics theory.
