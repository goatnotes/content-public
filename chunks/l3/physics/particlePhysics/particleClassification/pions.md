# Pions

Pions are a type of meson that were initially predicted as the mediator of the strong nuclear force (see ...). We now know that they do exist, and do indeed mediate this force.

They are the lightest of the mesons, and there are three types of pion:
	- The Pi+: $\pi^+$
	- The Pi-: $\pi^-$
	- The Pi^0: $\pi^0$

All the pions have roughly the same mass as each other, with relative charges following naturally from their names ($+1$, $-1$ and $0$).
