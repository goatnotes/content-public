The term **hadron** refers to any particle that experiences the **strong nuclear force**. Protons and neutrons are both hadrons, however, there are other unstable hadrons which can exist for short periods of time.

We can subdivide the hadrons into two groups. Hadrons which are also fermions we call **baryons**, and hadrons which are also bosons we call **mesons**. At the time of their initial classification, it was thought that all hadrons were fundamental particles, and hence no explanation for this distinction was presented. We now know this to be false, however, given that this is how the classification was made originally, I will leave discussion of what hadrons are *made of* to a later section.
