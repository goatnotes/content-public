As the name might suggest, the gauge bosons are bosonic particles, however, in particular they are the particles associated with the forces of nature. Gauge bosons are also called exchange particles because they mediate the **exchange** of properties between particles. In the simplest case, a gauge boson might mediate the exchange of momentum between two particles, causing the particles to deflect from one another. In more complex examples exchange particles mediate the exchange of internal quantum numbers, causing particles to change their identity.

There are 4 gauge bosons in the standard model. The photon, the gluon, the $W^{\pm}$ bosons and the $Z^0$ boson.
