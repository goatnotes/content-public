In particle physics there are lots of terms which are thrown about to describe particles - fermion, boson, hadron, quark, lepton, etc, etc, etc. Some terms are mutually exlusive (a particle is either a fermion or a boson, never both) or they can be used to describe the same particle (there are both fermionic and bosonic hadrons). Fundamentally there is nothing special about these terms, and historically they were used to describe some observable property of a particle. Some properties are mutually exclusive (a particle cannot both have mass and no mass at the same time) and some can exist together (a particle can have massless and have no charge), hence we obtain the same overlap in the words we use to describe the particles.

As I have said, there is nothing particularly special about how we classify particles - it is mainly for convenience. The universe didn't create the standrd model, we did. Over time, we have found that the terms we used to describe particles bore some relevance about what the particles were made from - however, it is important to understand that this discovery came afterwards, and that the terms were initially used to describe the *properties* of particles, not what they were made from.

Finally, the study of particle physics is inherently **empirical**. That is, we do not really know *why* the standard model is the way it is at all. We don't know why there are only 6 quarks we can observe (or if there might be more), or why the force carriers that exist do exist at all. Particle physics, to date, has largely been a job of looking for new particles, finding new particles, and then classifying them as best as possible in the existing particle physics model. This process has yeilded what is known as the **Standard Model**, which is embodies our complete understand of particle physics today.
