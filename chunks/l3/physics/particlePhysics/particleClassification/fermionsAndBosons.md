One of the most fundamental classifications we can make about a particle is whether it is a **fermion** or a **boson**. The existence of two fundamentally different types of particle (the fermion and the boson) is actually predicted by one of the founding axioms of quantum mechanics. It is a purely mathematical result that turns out to have physical significance, which we can observe empirically.

Loosely speaking bosons are particles associated with forces, and fermions are particles associated with matter. However, I emphasise that this as a loose distinction, and there are exceptions to this rule.

Rigorously speaking, fermions display anti-exchange symmetry, have half-integer spin, and obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Bosons display exchange symmetry, have integer spin, and do not obey the exclusion principle. What does all this mean?

The point about exchange symmetry is the mathematical point eluded to above. It means that in a system consisting of a number of identical fermions, exchanging the position of two fermions is mathematically equivelant to multiplying the wavefunction of the system by $-1$. In the case of bosons the wavefunction is left unchanged. The other two properties listed are mathematical consiquences of this fact.

The most interesting distinction between bosons and fermions is their being affected by the Pauli exclusion principle (or not affected as the case may be). The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two fermions can share a quantum state in a system. We observe this to be true, and it is what forces elecrons (being fermions) to fill the electronic orbitals of an atom, rather than all collecting in the lowest energy state [^1]. Bosons have no such restriction on their occupying the same state, and this is the principle behind lasers: Photons (being bosons) are induced into the same quantum state, creating completely coherent, and therefore very intense, light.

Finally, the terms 'fermion' and 'boson' apply to all particles, whether they are fundamental or composite. In fact, we can talk about atomic nuclei as being fermions or bosons (atomic nuclei of both types exist, hance why I am reluctant to talk about bosons as being exclusively force carrying particles), and as such certain isotopes of the same atom will behave very differently to each other, simply based on how the spins of their constituent nucleons add up.

[^1]: If fermions did not obey the Pauli exclusion principle, the field of chemistry wouldn't exist. All electrons would naturally fall into the lowest energy levels of an atom, and we would not observe electronic orbitals, and chemical bonding, in the way that we do.
