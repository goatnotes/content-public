Kaons were initially observed as heavier mesons which were produced easily in particle collisions (and always in pairs) but which decayed much more slowly than they should have done based on their mass.

It was postulated that Kaons possessed a property called strangeness, which was conserved in the strong and electromagnetic interactions, but which was not conserved in the weak interaction. This way, Kaons could be easily created in pairs in the strong force - quickly because strong reactions are generally fast, and in pairs to conserve strangeness (a particle of $+1$ and $-1$ strangeness would be created in each interaction). Then, in order for a Kaon to decay into a lighter particle (meaning that it's strangeness must *dissappear*) it would need to engage with the weak interaction - a much slower interaction, accounting for the unusually long lifetimes of the kaons.
