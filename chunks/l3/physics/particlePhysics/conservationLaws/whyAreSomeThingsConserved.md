The conservation of certain quantities is a mathematical consiquence that follows from the existence of certain symmetries in the universe. The idea that the laws are invariant under some symmetry (for example a translation in space, or a rotation) gives rise, through a mathematical effect called Noether's Theorem, to the conservation of many properties in physics.

It helps to have a better understanding of what we mean by symmetry here. When we say that something is symmetrical, what we are really saying is that there is something you can *do* to that *thing* which will not change it. So, for example, take a square: We can rotate the square by $90^o$ without changing the appearance of the square, and hence we say that a square has a $90^o$ rotational symmetry. In nature we apply the same logic: The laws of physics don't change depending on where you area, and hence we say that the nature obeys a symmetry with respect to a translation in space.

As an example of how Noether's theorem plays into this: The fact that the laws of physics are the same no matter where you are is what gives rise to conservation of momentum. In fact we can artifically construct closed systems in which this isn't the case. We could place a box in between two capacitor plates, hence generating an electric field within the box.

As far as anyone inside the box was concerned, their *laws of physics* (having no knowledge of the capacitor plates outside of the system) would not be the same everywhere - there would be a higher potential energy at one side of the box than at the other, with no explanation other than simply that being their law of nature. In this situation we also know that momentum would obviously not be conserved, as far as anyone inside the box was concerned: A charged particle could be placed at rest in the box and would appear to accelerate in the direction of the electric field, without any compensation by any other element within the box, to conserve momentum - momentum conservation would be violated.

Now, for anyone outside the box, however, momentum would be conserved, since the capactor plates would move to compensate the increased momentum of the charge.
