Conservation laws in particle physics is, in principle, exactly the same in particle physics as in classical physics: A group of particles undergo an interaction and there are certain, measurable quantities which are, in total, the same at the start and the end of the interaction.

The subtlety that arises in particle physics is that the interactions we deal with are modelled as being instantenous. In classical physics we can imagine all particle interactions as being virtually continuous: particles come in and out, with their positions and velocities changing continuously with time.

However, in particle physics interactions happen so quickly (maybe even instantenously) that a certain set of particles can come in with certian energies and momenta, and an instant later a different set of particles can exit with a new set of energies and momenta. However, the principle is the same: If you sum all of a conserved quantity before an interaction, and again after the interaction, you will get the same result.
