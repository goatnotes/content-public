Lepton number is not only conserved in *total*, but each generation of matter has it's own lepton number conserved seperately. What I mean by this is that there is one lepton number for the electron and electron neutrino (let's call it $L_e$) and a seperate lepton number for the muon and mu-neutrino (let's call it $L_\mu$) - there is also a lepton number for the tauon and tau-neutrino. Each of these quantum numbers is conserved seperately, not just the total lepton number, $L = L_e + L_\mu + \dots$.
