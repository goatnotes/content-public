The main conserved quantities to be aware of in particle physics are:
	- Energy
	- Momentum
	- Charge
	- Baryon Number
	- Lepton Number (counted seperately for each generation of matter)
	- Strangeness (conserved in all but the weak interaction)

Baryon Number, Lepton Number and Strangeness are subtle concepts at first: they are quantum numbers which describe the *type* of a particle. They are not really any different from the other properties on the list above, however. Energy is a property of a baryon in just the same way that *being a baryon* is a property of a baryon - these three quantum numbers are just mathematical ways of reflecting how particle's relate to one another.
