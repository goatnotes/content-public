Strangeness, as a quantum number, is conserved in the strong and electromagnetic interactions, but not the weak interaction (the other fundamental interaction in the standard model). Why is this?

Essentially, it is because the specific symmetry that is obeyed by the strong and electromagnetic interactions (a detailed discussion of which is beyond the scope of this section) that gives rise to strangeness conservation is not obeyed by the weak force. Hence, the weak force is able to violate the conservation of strangeness in a way that the strong and electromagnetic forces aren't.

Another way to think about this (although not really an explanation to *why* this is the case) is that we now know strangeness to be a result of the presence of strange quarks (there are also properties called charm-ness, top-ness and bottom-ness for the other quarks, however, these hold less historical significance than strangeness). If strangeness was to change in a particle interaction, it would require the conversion of a strange quark into another type of particle (either another type of quark or a lepton). This kind of interaction, where a quark is made to change it's *flavour* can only happen in the weak interaction - it's primarily what the weak interaction is responsible for.

I guess the answer the this question comes down to the fact that the weak force just works differently to the strong and electromagnetic forces, and hence can violate strangeness conservation (a slightly unsatisfying answer I know). I guess the important point to takeaway from this is that not all symmetries, and hence conservation laws, are universal - and strangeness is an example of one that isn't.
