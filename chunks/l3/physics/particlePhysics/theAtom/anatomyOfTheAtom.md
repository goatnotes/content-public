The atom is comprised of a dense nucleus, surrounded by a diffuse electron 'cloud'. The nucleus is made from protons and neutrons, bound together by the **strong nuclear force**, meaning it has a net positive charge. The surrounding electrons have a negative charge, and in a neutral atom the number of protons and electrons match up to give a net neutral charge (when the number of protons and electrons are not equal we would refer to the resultant atom as an ion rather than an atom).

The neutron is a neutral atom, meaning it has no charge, however the protons and the electron have relative charges of $+1$ and $-1$ respectively. Relative charge is a unit of charge measured relative to the charge of an electron. The electron has a charge of $1.6\times 10^{-19}\textrm{C}$, and a relative charge of $1$ equals an absolute charge of $1.6\times 10^{-19}$ coulombs.
