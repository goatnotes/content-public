Specific charge (also referred to as the charge-to-mass ratio) is the ratio of a particles **charge**, to it's **mass**:

$$
	\textrm{Charge-to-mass Ratio} = \frac{Q}{m}
$$

Where $Q$ is the charge of the particle and $m$ is the mass. The units of specific charge are simply the coulomb per kilogram ($Ckg^{-1}$).

The specific charge of a particle is a good way of gauging how easily a charge will be deflected in an **electromagnetic field**. A particle with a **high charge** and a **low mass** will be deflected more easily in such a field (since high charge means a greater force, and for a given force a low mass will yeild a greater acceleration) and so particles with **high** specific charges will generally deflect more easily.
