We can classify an atom by 2 numbers:
	- The atomic number: $Z$
	- The mass number: $A$

The atomic number is equal to the number of protons (and hence electrons) in the atom, and the mass number is equal to the total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons). Often you will see this information conveyed in the following notation:

$$
	X^{A}_{Z}
$$

Where $X$ is the symbol of the element that the atom belongs to, and the top and bottom numbers are the mass and nucleon (atomic) number respectively.

Finally, we say two atoms are isotopes of one another if they have the same number of protons, and a different number of neutrons. Two isotopes (generally speaking) behave the same chemically, but show different physical properties (namely their mass).
