The exam will often ask you to work out the specific charge of a nucleus, an ion, or an atom. It's easy to skim over reading these questions, in the exam, and hence the papers can often trick you into writing the wrong thing.

The specific charge of an **atom** is *always* zero - since atom's are, by definition, neutral.

The specific charge of a **nucleus** of an atom, is the charge of the nucleus ($\textrm{number of protons}\times e = eZ$) divided by the mass of the nucleus (the mass number of the atom):

$$
	\textrm{CMR}_{\textrm{nucleus}} = \frac{Ze}{A}
$$

Where $e=1.6\times 10^{-19}C$.

The specific charge of an **ion** is the net charge of the ion divided by the mass number of the atom. To find the net charge you take the difference between the number of protons and neutrons. If the ion has **gained** electrons, the specific charge will be **negative**, and if the ion has lost electrons, it will be **positive**.
