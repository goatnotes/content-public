> Particles *want* to decay into lighter particles.

The term 'want' may be an unfortunate use of language, but it gets the point across. Particles will, so long as they can without breaking conservation laws, decay into lighter particles.

This is a natural consiquence of the more general tendency of systems to seek out the lowest possible energy configuration. This is a fact in classical mechanics as well as quantum mechanics, and is one of the most universal facts in physics. In particle physics it just tends to manifest itself in the fact that particles will always decay into lighter (lower energy) particles if they can.

This isn't to say that particles will decay instantly - they wont. Just like all particle interactions, interactions governing the decay of particles have a **probability** of occuring, and the higher this probability the faster the particle will *on average* decay. In general, heavier particles decay more readily, largely because heavier particles have more particles that are lighter than themsevels, and hence have more routes for decay, while obeying conservation of energy (or conservation of mass equivelantly).

This fact makes almost all particles unstable - that is, they will eventually decay. There are very few stable particles, and the only thing stopping stable particles from decaying is that there is *no way* for them to decay without breaking conservation laws (usually to do with conservation of energy and one other law).

For example, the electron is a stable particle because it is the lightest charged particle. It can't decay into a heavier charged particle since this would violate conservation of energy (mass) and it can't decay into a lighter non-charged particle as this would violate conservation of charge.
