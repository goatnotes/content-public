> There are certain conserved quantities in the universe which cannot change in a particle interaction.

Examples of such quantities are energy and momentum (familiar conserved quantities from classical physics), however, there are many more conserved quantities in particle physics which, according to the laws of physics *cannot* change during a particle interaction.

Although there is some very interesting maths surrounding conservation laws there isn't really a reason *why* this is the case - it just is.
