> The existence of the fundamental particles is, as far as we know, an empirical fact of nature.

This is an important point. The standard model - the basis for all of the proceeding discussion on particle physics - is a precisely what it says it is - a model. It is essentially a body of maths that *describes* the relatioships between particles and forces. It will tell you how two particles are able to interact with each other, and what they might do, but it won't tell you why.

As a good example, the standard model does not predict the masses of particles. You'll often hear that the Higgs mechanism *gives* particles mass, and loosely speaking it does. However, it does not explain *why* certain particles have different masses. The masses of the particles are free parameters in the standard model, which we have to manually set based on empirical measurements of the particles.
