> A given particle interaction will happen if, and only if, conservation laws permit it to.

The laws of particle physics are inherently quantum in nature. What this means is that every possible particle interaction (possible meaning that it isn't prohibited by conservation laws) has a certain probability of occuring. However low this probability is, if you wait long enough, the interaction will occur - we say that the interaction happens **sponteneously**. This is an unusual property of quantum mechanics - that things can happen sponteneously without apparent cause - but it is a property nontheless.

Note that this concept goes two ways: A given interaction can *only* happen if conservation laws permit it to, *and* if conservation laws do permit an interaction to happen, it will.
