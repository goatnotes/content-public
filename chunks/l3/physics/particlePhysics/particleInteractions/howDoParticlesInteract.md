A *particle interaction* is exactly what it sounds like: it is a bunch of particles coming into contact with each other, doing *something*, possibily turning into a different set of particles, and then leaving each other.

There are two important questions to answer when dealing with a given particle interaction:
	- *Can* it happen?
	- *Will* it happen?

The first of these questions is answered by examination of conservation laws. You take what went into the interaction, and what comes out of the interaction, and if all conservation laws are obeyed (energy, momentum and all internal quantum numbers) then the interaction *can* happen.

Secondly, if a particle interaction *can* happen, then given enough time it *will* happen [^1]. Due to the quantum nature of particle physics, all particle interactions are inherently spontaneous; that is, they have a **probability** of happening, but fundamentally occur randomly. Every particle interaction that *can* happen, has a certain probability of occuring, and so you only have to wait enough time and you will probably see it happen (of course there is the possibility that it never does happen, however unlikely it is. However, the chance of a given interaction *never* occuring is so demonstrably small that we can effectively take it as a certainty that it will occur at some point).
