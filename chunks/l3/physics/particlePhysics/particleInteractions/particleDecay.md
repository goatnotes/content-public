It is observed that some particles in nature (in fact, most particles) are unstable, meaning that they undergo **spontaneous** particle interactions involving their breakdown into lighter - or equivelantly, **lower energy** - particles.

*How* a particle decays (i.e. into what particles) is known as it's **decay mode**, and it is possible for a particle to have several decay modes, each with an individual probability of occurring. Many sequential decays will happen, in a chain, until a stable particle is produced.

There are very few stable particles, and according to the standard model only the following particles are stable (that is they will never spontaneously decay):
	- The proton
	- The electron
	- The electron neutrino
	- The photon
	- The gluon

And all their corresponding anti-particles.

All other particles in nature are thought (and for the most part are observed to) decay into these 5 particles. All free baryons (not in the nucleus of an atom) eventually decay into the proton, all leptons eventually decay into either the electron or electron neutrino, and the $W^\pm$ and $Z_0$ bosons are able to decay into either mesons or leptons.
