The fact that some particles are unstable, and some particles are stable (or at least have half lives above all current experimental observations) seems odd at first assessment - it seems like the universe arbitrarily decided that some particles were going to be stable, and others unstable. However, I hope to show here that there is nothing at all arbitrary about why some particles are unstable.

The root of it comes down the same law that governs basically every other natural process: Systems tend towards the state of lowest energy. This immediately explains why particles decay: A heavy particles (a high energy particle) wants to break up into two lower energy particles in order to lower the overall energy of the system. This also agrees with the experimental observation that heavier particles, generally, have shorter half lives - it is because there is a greater 'energy gradient' driving them to decay [^1]. The process by which particles do this is inherently random (spontaneous is the word we might use), due to the quantum nature of particle physics, however, statistically heavier particles are more likely to decay per unit time.

This only leaves the question of why some particles are stable. This is because of conservation laws. Conservation of energy implies that a particle can only decay into particles that are lighter than itself, and conservation of various internal quantum numbers (baryon number, lepton number, etc) put restrictions of what kinds of particle a particle can decay into.

Take the free proton for example (a proton that is not in a nucleus). It cannot decay into a bunch of electrons, or into a photon, or anything other than a baryon, since this would violate conservation of baryon number. However, there are no baryons which the proton can decay into either, since the proton is the lightest (and hence lowest energy) baryon which can possible exist. Therefore, we conclude that the proton must be a stable particle - there is nowhere for it to go. And to within all experimental limits, this is what we observe.

[^1]: Think of balls rolling down hills. The reason the particle feels a force pushing it down the hill is because there is a potential energy gradient pointing down the hill. The ball is *seeking* the lowest energy state it can, and so falls towards the local minimum (the bottom of the hill).
