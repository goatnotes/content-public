All system's have an **internal energy** which can be thought of as the energy of the particles *within* the system, not including the energy of the whole system itself (i.e. if the whole system is moving, or the potential energy of the system due to potentials external from the system).

Thermodynamics does not actually define internal energy in any absolute sense, but only how the internal energy of a system changes (this is the first law of thermodynamics). In this sense, there is no absolute internal energy of a system, and internal energy can only be meaningfully thought of in the context of comparing the internal energy of two systems.
