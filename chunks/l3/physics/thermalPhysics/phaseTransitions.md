A phase transition is the process by which matter *changes it's physics form* in a system. The classic examples are phase transitions from solid to liquid, or liquid to gas, however, in general there are many more phases of matter that can exist, and phase transitions between all types of phases can occur.

The simplest type of phase transition is the **first-order phase transition**, in which a system releases or absorbs a fixed amount of heat per volume, to undergo a change of state. In this process the kinetic energies of the particles in the system do not change - only the potential energies of the particle's change. This happens via the particles moving either closer together, or further appart from one another, and hence first order phase transitions typically involve a change in volume of a sample.

Melting ice or boiling water are both examples of first-order phase transitions.
