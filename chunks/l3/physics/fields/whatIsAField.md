Originally fields where mathematical tools. It was observed that certain objects (for example charged objects) experienced non-gravitional forces in some regions of space. The magnitude of this force was proportional to the magnitude of the charge of the object and hence it was deemed there was some force acting on the particle that was linked to the particle's charge.

Further, it was observed that the force acting on the object would generally change as the object moved through space, which implied there was some changing property of space which caused the force acting on the object to change. The way this was modelled mathematically was the *invention* of the field.

The field is a mathematical object, which has a value assigned to each point in space. This value is then used to calculate the force that would act on the object at each point in space. Fields exist that do not relate to forces too - If we want to map the temperature of a room we would assign each point in space with a value that gives the temperature of the room at that point. The temperature field is a scalar field, meaning there is a scalar (a number) assigned to each point of space. However, other fields do exist.

Fields that describe forces (for example the electic force discussed before) require vector fields (where a vector, instead of a number, is assigned to each point in space). This characterises how both the magnitude and direction of the electic force change with position.

In classical physics fields are simply mathematical tools; they are used to model how forces act on bodies. After all, classical mechanics is simply a model used to describe the motion of bodies through space. The electromagnetic or gravitational fields that are described by classical physics do not really have any physical significance. Where these forces actually come from (fundamentally) is not addressed by classical, non-reletavistic physics.

So what about in quantum physics. Our best working theory for describing the universe currently is quantum field theory, which described the whole universe as arising due to the interactions of fields (not too different at all from those described above). There are fields (mathematical objecys), and then there are some equations which described how those fields interact with one another - that's it.

It is tempting to ask what quantum fields are made from. Although we might find one day that there is a level beneath the quantum field (like when we found that atoms were made from smaller particles), then we would just ask what those *things* were made from. At some level there is going to be a thing which we can't explain because it just *is*.

I understand as much as anyone how unsatisying this answer can be, but I don't find it anywhere near as unsatisfying as I once did. What does it even mean for something to be *real*? To be *made* of something.

I think a fairly convincing answer to this question is that for something to be *real* it has to have some form of energy associated with it (or mass, since in QFT the distinction between the two is virtually non-existent).

And that is perhaps the best answer I can give to what a field *is*: Fields *are* energy. This is a lovely conclusion to come to since all the most elegant theories of physics (starting with Lagrange's beautiful formulation of classical mechanics in terms of the Lagrangian) use energy to describe the world. They don't say what energy *is*, they simply postulate that it does and work upwards.

And perhaps that is the answer after all. The universe is made from energy - and energy is made of the universe. The two are one in the same thing. Think about it however you want.

I guess, put in one line, you *could* say: Fields are mathematical objects which describe the interaction of energy in the universe. But whether you believe that is up to you.
