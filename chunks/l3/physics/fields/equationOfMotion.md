In the general formulation of a field theory we some set of equations (there are actually going to be only two) which tell us:
1. The force experienced by a particle due to a field.
2. The field generated by a particle's presence in a region of space.

# Equation of Force

Let's suppose that our field is represented by the vector valued function $\Phi(\tor x): \tor x \rightarrow\tor v$, and that we have some particle with the corresponding charge $\alpha$. Then the force, $\tor F(\tor x)$, experienced by the particle at position $\tor x$ is given by the equation,

$$
	\tor F(\tor x) = \alpha\Phi(\tor x)
$$

That is, the scalar charge multiplied by the vector field.

# Equation of field generation

Let's suppose that we have a particle with charge $\alpha$. The field generated around the point charge $\alpha$ will be spherically symmetric, meaning that at any given point, the field vector will point radially (either directly towards or directly away from the charge) and will have a magnitude that only depends on the distance that point is from the charge (imagine constructing a sphere of some radius around the charge - the magnitude of the field vectors will be the same everywhere on the surface of that sphere, and will all point normal to the surface of the sphere). This means that the equation for our field, $\Phi(\tor x)$, should actually take the form, $\Phi(r)$, where $r$ is the distance of a point from the center of the charge. We also suppose that the value of the field generated is proportional to the charge of the particle, and so we obtain the relationship,

$$
	\Phi(r) \propto \alpha f(r) \hat{\tor r}
$$

where $f(r)$ is some function of $r$, and $\hat{\tor r}$ is the unit vector (has magnitude $1$) pointing radially away from the charge.

# Form of the Radial Function

The radial function $f(r)$ takes it's form based on a number of factors, however, for both electric and
