When describing the mechanics of non-contact forces we also need to take account of the particle's end of the coupling. We do this by supposing that each particle in nature has some intrinsic property, which we will call $\alpha$, that couples it to the field. In electromagnetism this property is electric charge, in gravitation it is mass (at the quantum level mass works slightly differently but in classical physics they are considered as being analagous to each other). This property is an intrinsic part of the particle - it is part of what makes the particle the particle that it is, and so the theory doesn't really concern itself with *why* the particle has that property.

In general, the property $\alpha$ is just called **charge** (although not always). We can then specify what type of charge we are refering to: In electromagnetism we hace electric charge, in strong interactions we have color charge, etc. Often the word *charge* is used to just mean electric charge, but be aware that it has this double meaning.

Some particles don't have charge, and hence don't interact with the electromagnetic field. Some particles don't have mass and so (at least in classical non-reletavistic physics) don't interact with the gravitational field.
