Many text books will outline the specific mechanisms of the electric and gravitational fields (in classical non-reletavistic mechanics) and then conclude by displaying the similarities between the two, and pointing out where the two differ. I wish to do something different here: Create a general idea for what a theory of a field *should* look like, and then use that to construct theories for the gravitational and electric fields in a way that you should be able to see where the theories come from. [As an aside, I also think that the maths describing Newton's law of gravitation and the coulomb (electric) force are identical. They are not just similar, they are the same maths, but the only difference being that we don't observe objects with negative mass in classical physics, but negative charge does exist, hence allowing for the repulsion, as well as the attraction, of two bodies.]
