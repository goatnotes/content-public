When one learns of generalized coordinates - and in particular the idea that the laws of physics can really be written in any coordinate system - the natural question to ask is: Is there a formulation of physics which doesn't reference a specific set of coordinates - that is, it is coordinate agnostic?

The answer is yes. There is a branch of mechanics (which I won't go into the details of here) called Lagrangian mechanics. Lagrangian mechanics formulates the laws of mechanics in terms of generalized coordinates (that is, not worrying about what the specific coordinates represent, just assuming that we have *some* set of coordinates), and can be used to derive linear and rotational mechanics simply by using the appropriate coordinate system in the outset. Lagrangian mechancis can also be used to derive an equally *correct* theory of mechanics in any coordinate system we can construct.

Hopefully this goes some way to putting to rest the conceptual difficulties that arise when dealing with rotational mechanics, viewing it as the same mechanics just viewed from a different angle. Much of the rotational mechanics you will be taught (circular motion and rotating rigid bodies) deals with polar coordinates in which we fix the radial coordinate, and as such only have one equation of motion. This is just a product of our fixing the radial coordinate, it has nothing to do with the physics - or at least not that much.
