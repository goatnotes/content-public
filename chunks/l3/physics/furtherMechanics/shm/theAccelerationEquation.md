The acceleration equation can be obtain by a second differentiation of the position equation of SHM.

$$*
	a(t) = \frac{\dee^2}{\dee t^2}x(t) = -A\omega^2\cos(\omega t + \phi)
$$

We could have also made use of the defining equation of SHM,

$$
	a = -\omega^2x = -\omega^2(A\cost(\omega t + \phi))
$$

Notice that the maximum absolute value of the acceleration is $A\omega^2$.

Plotting this against the position equation we see that the acceleration is in antiphase with the position of the particle (i.e. always directing it back towards equilibrium). This is, again, also clear from the defining equation of SHM. Because of this, the acceleration of the oscillator lags $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians behind the velocity of the particle.


# A in terms of X

Finding an equation for $a$ in terms of $x$ is trivial - it is simply the defining equation itself.

$$
	a = -\omega^2 x
$$

We can plot this,

And we see that it peaks at the edges of the cycle, and unlike the velocity equation it only has one branch to it (since the acceleration always points towards equilibrium at any point in the cycle).
