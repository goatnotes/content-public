The mass spring system is set-up as shown below.

[DIAGRAM]

We can derive an equation of motion for this system by using Hooke's law:

$$
	F = -kx
$$

Using Newton's second law, we can further write,

$$
	F = ma = -kx
$$

And hence,

$$
	a = -\frac{k}{m}x
$$

Now, we can notice that this *is* exactly the equation of SHM, in the case $\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m}$, and so we conclude that the mass-spring system shows perfect SHM, with angular frequency,

$$
	\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
$$

We can use the relation $T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$ to obtain an expression for the time period of the mass-spring system,

$$*
	T = 2\pi\frac{m}{k}
$$
