It has been derived elsewhere that the simple pendulum, subject to a set of approximations listed with their derivation, obeys the coupled set of differential equations,

$$
	mg\cos\theta - T = -m\dot{\theta}^2r
$$

$$
	\ddot r \theta + 2\dot r\dot \theta + r\ddot\theta = -g\sin\theta
$$

An understanding of where these equations come from is not required in order to understand this section, as here we will be exploring what these equations mean qualitatively.
