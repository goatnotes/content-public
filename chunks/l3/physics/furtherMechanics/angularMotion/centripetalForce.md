Newton's second law states:

> An object's acceleration is directly proportional to the force exerted on it.

Let's have a think about circular motion in the context of this law. In particular, when our particle is moving in a circle, is it accelerating?

The answer is yes. Although the magnitude of the velocity of the particle stays constant, the direction of the particle's motion is constantly changing. Since velocity is a vector quantity, if the direction of the motion is changing constantly, then it's velocity is also changing, and hence there is an acceleration. It is then only a small logical leap to hypthesise the existence of some force (the centripetal force) which must be constantly exerted on the object in order to keep it moving in a circle.

Let's call the centripetal force $F_c$, and the centripetal acceleration $a_c$. Trivially, we can write,

$$
	F_c = ma_c
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the particle. It can be proven that the centripetal acceleration is given by,

$$*
	a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2 r
$$

And acts **towards the center of the circle**. Where $v$ is specifically the *magnitude* of the velocity.
